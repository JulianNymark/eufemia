## Description Modal V1

Using modal v1 is deprecated. The documentation is only provided for backward compatibility. We recommend everyone to update the implemented Modal components to either Drawer or Dialog.

## Sizing and spacing

You have the properties `min_width` and `max_width`. But by using these, the width styles get injected inline, which normal circumstances work fine. But in case you want to set it by CSS, you can do so:

```css
/* Change the Modal size  */
.dnb-modal__content__inner {
  min-width: 20vw;
  max-width: 40rem;
}

/* Change the Modal spacing  */
:root {
  /* Defaults to --spacing-large */
  --modal-spacing: var(--spacing-small);
}
```

## Mode Drawer

### Drawer content wrapper

To make it easier to have another colored area below the title, you can make use of the extra wrapper `<Modal.Content>`. Underneath, the [Section](/uilib/components/section) is used, but with the color `black-3` as default. This extra "section" is also customized to work together with the Modal and Drawer component.

```jsx
<Modal mode="drawer">
  <Modal.Content>Drawer Content</Modal.Content>
</Modal>
```

### Drawer bar and header

You can provide custom content to both the drawer bar and header. You can provide it either as a React property (`bar_content` and `header_content`), or by markup.

You may want to provide the title heading as a property. But if you need to, you can also provide a `<H1 />` Eufemia Component inside the header.

```jsx
<Modal mode="drawer" title="Heading title">
  <Modal.Bar>Drawer Bar Content</Modal.Bar>
  <Modal.Header>Drawer Header Content</Modal.Header>
  <Modal.Content>Drawer Content</Modal.Content>
</Modal>
```

See [demo](/uilib/components/modal#drawer-mode-with-custom-header) for more details.
